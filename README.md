# Amethyst Challenge Game - Snake

## Objectives
- Place food wherever on the grid that extends the snake by 1.
- Implement what should happen when a snake dies (game over).
  - Snake should also die when it hits the edge of the screen (tile position is smaller than 0 or greater than the grid length)
- Implement a scoring system (keep track of the length of the snake when it is extended).

## Extra:
- Allows food to extend the snake a variable amount of times.
- Allow local multiplayer (same keyboard, different controls) with snake deaths.
